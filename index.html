    <p>I've been using HTML and the like for nearly ten years, back since the days of geocities.</p>
    <P>I've worked on a few websites, nothing big, I guess most of my HTML usage was for ebay listings.  Honestly, most of what I made I simply made with notepad, so I guess I wasn't as strict as I should have been.</P>
    <P>One of the things I have to remember more is to close my tags (especially p's and li's), using em and strong instead of i and b, and not abuse titles and the like, trying to keep it ordered, like you said.</P>
